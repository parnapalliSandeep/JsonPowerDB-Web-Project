# JsonPowerDB-Web-Project
Title of the Project:Created a webpage using html and linked JsonPowerDB Database using javascript<br />
Description:<br />
1.In this project I have created a basic webform using HTML by taking 3 inputs from user namely Employee ID,Employee Name and Email.<br />
2.I have used javascript to link JsonPowerDB database to store and retrieve data.<br />
3.So whenever you click save the data gets stored in jsonPowerDB database and can be retrived whenever required.<br />
4.I have used many functions in javasript to perform various functions.<br />
5.However some of the functions are already present in shared library and we can use then directly.<br />
Benefits of using JsonPowerDB:
1.It is simple to use.<br />
2.It is schema free so that we maintain easily.<br />
3.It has a serverless support which helps to run database in cloud without managing any database instances.<br />
4.multi-mode database which helps to use same database for multiple applications.<br />
5.All columns are automatically created during the first put command.<br />
6.webservices api.<br />
7.Inbuilt support.<br />
8.Higher security.<br />
9.Serverside Native NoSQL which has a best performance.<br />
10.Works using key-value pair.<br />
11.It reduces the devolopment cost.<br />
12.It can be pluggable with new algorithms.<br />
13.It fills the gap from database to big-data.<br />
